### 0.4

Templates are now compiled on the server so must be referred to with "template" rather than "template_url".

Step template wrappers are no longer a thing.

The episode is compiled onto the pathway as an array.

If a model is a singleton then the client side is given a single item.

Alternatively you can use the SingleModelStep(model=yourModel) in your pathway. this will put the last subrecord of yourModel onto the scope.
